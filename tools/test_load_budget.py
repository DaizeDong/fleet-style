"""Regression suite for tools/load_budget.py, the PHILOSOPHY P7 gate.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
    load_budget.py was wired into CI (.github/workflows/load-budget.yml) with no tests at all, while
    the two guards it sits beside, dash_guard and pii_guard, each run their own suite as the FIRST
    step of their own workflow. That asymmetry is not cosmetic. Both of those suites exist because
    their guard once printed a clean result over a scan that never happened, and the only thing that
    catches that class of bug is a test that feeds the guard something bad and demands red.

    So the shape of this file is deliberate: every guarantee load_budget makes has a POSITIVE test
    (good input, exit 0) paired with a NEGATIVE CONTROL (bad input, nonzero exit, and the specific
    word the report must say). A test that cannot go red is not a test, and a suite of only-green
    tests over a gate is the same disease the gate was built to cure, one level up.

    Each negative control below is annotated with what breaks it, i.e. what edit to load_budget.py
    would make that specific test pass vacuously. If you change the tool and a NEG test still passes,
    check that it is still reaching the branch it names before believing it.

HOW IT RUNS THE TOOL
    Through subprocess, on a synthetic repo built in tmp_path, never by importing and calling main().
    The thing under test is the EXIT CODE as CI and the hooks observe it, and an in-process call
    cannot catch a wrapper that swallows a status. Fixtures are entirely synthetic prose; nothing in
    here is copied from any real SKILL.md.
